## Phase 2: Core MCP Server Implementation

### 2.1 MCP Server Foundation

- [ ] Implement MCP protocol handlers

### 2.2 QR Code Reading Tool
- [ ] Implement `qr_code_read` MCP tool
- [ ] Create image input validation and handling
- [ ] Integrate OpenCV for QR code detection
- [ ] Implement QR code decoding functionality
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid images or missing QR codes
- [ ] Return decoded QR code value as string response

### 2.3 Image Processing Module
- [ ] Create dedicated module for image processing (`src/qr_code_reader/image_processor.py`)
- [ ] Implement image loading from various formats (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- [ ] Add image preprocessing for better QR code detection
- [ ] Handle image scaling and rotation if needed
- [ ] Optimize for different QR code sizes and qualities

## Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Create test suite for image processing functions
- [ ] Write tests for QR code detection and decoding
- [ ] Test MCP tool integration and responses
- [ ] Create test fixtures with sample QR code images
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios (invalid images, no QR codes)

### 3.2 Test Coverage
- [ ] Set up pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- [ ] Achieve target coverage threshold (>90%)
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to Makefile
- [ ] Configure coverage exclusions for appropriate files

### 3.3 Code Quality
- [x] Set up black for code formatting
- [x] Configure ruff for linting and static analysis
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
- [x] Ensure all code passes linting and formatting checks

## Phase 4: Integration & Documentation

### 4.1 MCP Integration Testing
- [ ] Test server startup and shutdown
- [ ] Verify MCP tool registration
- [ ] Test end-to-end image processing workflow
- [ ] Validate response format and error handling

### 4.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with various image sizes and formats
- [ ] Benchmark QR code detection speed
- [ ] Test memory usage with large images
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks if found

### 4.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Document MCP tool interface and parameters
- [ ] Add examples of QR code images and expected outputs
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Phase 5: Deployment & Finalization

### 5.1 Packaging
- [ ] Ensure proper Python packaging with uv
- [ ] Test installation from package
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are correctly specified
- [ ] Test in clean environment

### 5.2 Final Validation
- [ ] Run complete test suite
- [ ] Verify all Makefile targets work correctly
- [ ] Test with various QR code types (URL, text, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure MCP server integrates properly with AI agents

### 5.3 Production Readiness
- [ ] Add logging for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement graceful error handling
- [ ] Add input sanitization and security considerations
- [ ] Optimize for production deployment

## Phase 6: Containerization & Deployment

### 6.1 Docker Implementation
- [ ] Create optimized Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [ ] Configure container security and non-root user
- [ ] Add health checks and proper signal handling
- [ ] Optimize image size and dependencies

### 6.2 Docker Compose Development
- [ ] Set up development environment with docker-compose
- [ ] Configure volume mounts for development
- [ ] Add environment variables for configuration
- [ ] Enable hot-reloading for development

### 6.3 Container Testing
- [ ] Test MCP server in containerized environment
