# QR Code Reader MCP Server - Development Tasks

This document outlines the complete roadmap for delivering the QR Code Reader MCP Server as specified in the README.md.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

### 1.1 Python Environment Setup
- [ ] Initialize Python project with uv package management
- [ ] Create `pyproject.toml` with project metadata and dependencies
- [ ] Set up virtual environment with `uv venv`
- [ ] Install core dependencies: opencv-python, mcp (Model Context Protocol)
- [ ] Configure development dependencies: pytest, pytest-cov, black, ruff

### 1.2 Project Structure
- [ ] Create `src/` directory for source code
- [ ] Create `tests/` directory for unit tests
- [ ] Create `src/qr_code_reader/` package directory
- [ ] Add `__init__.py` files for proper Python packaging

### 1.3 Build System
- [ ] Create Makefile with common development commands
- [ ] Add targets: install, test, coverage, lint, format, run
- [ ] Ensure Makefile follows project conventions

## Phase 2: Core MCP Server Implementation

### 2.1 MCP Server Foundation
- [ ] Implement basic MCP server structure
- [ ] Set up server initialization and configuration
- [ ] Create main entry point (`src/main.py` or `src/qr_code_reader/server.py`)
- [ ] Implement MCP protocol handlers

### 2.2 QR Code Reading Tool
- [ ] Implement `qr_code_read` MCP tool
- [ ] Create image input validation and handling
- [ ] Integrate OpenCV for QR code detection
- [ ] Implement QR code decoding functionality
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid images or missing QR codes
- [ ] Return decoded QR code value as string response

### 2.3 Image Processing Module
- [ ] Create dedicated module for image processing (`src/qr_code_reader/image_processor.py`)
- [ ] Implement image loading from various formats (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- [ ] Add image preprocessing for better QR code detection
- [ ] Handle image scaling and rotation if needed
- [ ] Optimize for different QR code sizes and qualities

## Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Create test suite for image processing functions
- [ ] Write tests for QR code detection and decoding
- [ ] Test MCP tool integration and responses
- [ ] Create test fixtures with sample QR code images
- [ ] Test error handling scenarios (invalid images, no QR codes)

### 3.2 Test Coverage
- [ ] Set up pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- [ ] Achieve target coverage threshold (>90%)
- [ ] Add coverage reporting to Makefile
- [ ] Configure coverage exclusions for appropriate files

### 3.3 Code Quality
- [ ] Set up black for code formatting
- [ ] Configure ruff for linting and static analysis
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Ensure all code passes linting and formatting checks

## Phase 4: Integration & Documentation

### 4.1 MCP Integration Testing
- [ ] Test server startup and shutdown
- [ ] Verify MCP tool registration
- [ ] Test end-to-end image processing workflow
- [ ] Validate response format and error handling

### 4.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with various image sizes and formats
- [ ] Benchmark QR code detection speed
- [ ] Test memory usage with large images
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks if found

### 4.3 Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with installation and usage instructions
- [ ] Document MCP tool interface and parameters
- [ ] Add examples of QR code images and expected outputs
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues

## Phase 5: Deployment & Finalization

### 5.1 Packaging
- [ ] Ensure proper Python packaging with uv
- [ ] Test installation from package
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are correctly specified
- [ ] Test in clean environment

### 5.2 Final Validation
- [ ] Run complete test suite
- [ ] Verify all Makefile targets work correctly
- [ ] Test with various QR code types (URL, text, etc.)
- [ ] Ensure MCP server integrates properly with AI agents

### 5.3 Production Readiness
- [ ] Add logging for debugging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement graceful error handling
- [ ] Add input sanitization and security considerations
- [ ] Optimize for production deployment

## Development Dependencies

Based on the requirements, the following dependencies will be needed:

### Core Dependencies
- `opencv-python`: Computer vision and QR code detection
- `mcp`: Model Context Protocol implementation
- `pillow`: Additional image format support

### Development Dependencies
- `pytest`: Testing framework
- `pytest-cov`: Coverage reporting
- `black`: Code formatting
- `ruff`: Linting and static analysis
- `mypy`: Type checking (optional)

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered complete when:
- [x] MCP server successfully starts and registers the `qr_code_read` tool
- [x] Server can process various image formats containing QR codes
- [x] Returns accurate decoded QR code values
- [x] Handles errors gracefully (invalid images, no QR codes found)
- [x] Achieves >90% test coverage
- [x] All code passes linting and formatting checks
- [x] Makefile provides all necessary development commands
- [x] Documentation is complete and accurate
